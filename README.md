# MyReads Project

This is my implementation for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The app is a book categorizer, which has two main views: one for listing books and one for searching.

# How to run the project
1. Clone this repository
2. Cd to the app directory
3. Run ```npm install``` to install the dependencies
4. Then run ```npm start``` to start the dev server
